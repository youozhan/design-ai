## tools
[YOLO: Real-Time Object Detection](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/)

Single neural network applied to the full image; This network divides the image into regions and predicts bounding boxes and probabilities for each region.

[Sabin installation at Microsoft Research turns AI into art](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1h8DCveggyjhf0ZKSiHVnlaZLpI9VLp5GNHzqiil64sM/edit?usp=sharing)

Intersection of architecture, art and science; uses AI to process facial patterns and the emotions they reveal as data; Microsoft Research's most recent artist-in-residence; "Ada" integrates Sabin's use of new technologies in architecture with Microsoft's data science and programming expertise to create a responsive space that reflects the collective human experience; Not just about producing and designing a beautiful, interactive form.

## xai

[Google's new 'Explainable AI' service](https://towardsdatascience.com/googles-new-explainable-ai-xai-service-83a7bc823773)

AI being used in - healthcare, I.T. services, finance, manufacturing, autonomous driving, video game playing, scientific discovery, and the criminal justice system. Reasons to offer explainability - improve human readability, determine the justifiability of the decision made by the machine, help in deciding accountability, liability leading to good policy making, avoid discrimination, reduce societal bias. XAI to visualize - discriminative features, activation of neural net layers, incorporating behavior models in the system.
